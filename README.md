# Phishing Campaign Simulation

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about phishing attacks and to help individuals understand how to recognize and avoid them. Phishing is one of the most common cyber threats, and it relies on social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, financial data, or personal details. By simulating a phishing campaign, the project allows participants to experience real-world scenarios in a safe and controlled environment, without any risk of actual harm.
